Required machine spec
    RAM = more than 128Gbyte

input:   8bit.tif file (512pix x 512pix x 28000frames). Detail is as follows:
         After corrected for motion artifact using Suite2p, 
         16bit files were converted to 8bit tif file, which in turn smoothed with a Gaussian filter (Ïƒ = 2).
         
output:  32bit.tif file. Note, keep the file size less than 4Gbyte if you want to open the file on ImageJ. 
         When you open the file with 4Gbyte or more on imageJ, frame number would be something wrong (added 9 frames on ImageJ because of the header of tiff file).
